client.go
=========

This file runs the client part of the homework. It gets a list of registered servers,
looks for the last one that is registered for "trim0055", connects to it, uploads 10M bytes,
times the transaction, and uploads the time data to the database.

It also gets and prints the last time uploads to the database.



server.go
=========

Server registers itself with the server registry using it's local IP address and port, and
services the receipt of 10M bytes, responding with FIN. This can be used to time upload
speed on the client.

Note that the server registers itself with its preferred interface's IP address. This is a LAN
IP, but anything else is unreasonable to expect give the nature of NAT and firewalls.



Running these programs
======================

In a fully configured Go Environment (http://golang.org/doc/code.html) you will be able to run the
client and server code directly with:

go run server.go
go run client.go

The code is tested to run on any host (where the 2 machines share a LAN connection), and the Go
programming languauge is available as a module on CSE labs computers.
